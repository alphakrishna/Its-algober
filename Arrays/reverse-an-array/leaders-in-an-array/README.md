## Leaders in an array

Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to print all the Leaders in the array. An element is a Leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.

_Note: The rightmost element is always a leader._

**Examples:**

Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2} 

Output: 17 5 2

Explanation: 17 is greater than all the elements to its right: 4, 3, 5 and 2, therefore 17 is a leader. 5 is greater than all the elements to its right: 2, therefore 5 is a leader. 2 has no element to its right, therefore 2 is a leader.
